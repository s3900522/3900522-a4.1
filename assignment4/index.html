    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
  <p>Perceive the Pattern is a video created using premiere pro, using footage from the Computer Chronicles documentary and audio from the Medium is the Message. The intent of this work is to repurpose footage and audio from these sources to create a new video, with a tense narrative around technology acting as a whistleblower around its own dangers. The video was created within Premiere Pro, in which clips were taken from the Computer Chronicles documentary, and audio was taken from the Medium is the Message documentary. Sound effects were then used from FreeSound.com to add the overall theme of the video. </p>

 <h3>Process</h3>
<p>Within Perceive the Pattern (2022), I chose the theme and genre of horror as it created a challenging yet interesting was to transform my audio and visual components into something entirely new. In approaching the relationship between the sonic and visual components in the video, I first needed to understand the visual components I had available. I initially chose to video clips from Virtual Reality - Computer Chronicles (1992), as different shots in this video were intriguing to me in how they could be manipulated with audio and editing to change the tone of the video. The idea of technology being something to fear is something I have found interesting in popular shows such as Black Mirror, or movies such as Ex Machina (2015) or Videodrome (1983). Using the footage, I used audio from ‘This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Message’. The audio in this documentary was foreboding and cautionary, which I thought could be paired well with the visuals from the VR video. Through editing, I build a relationship between these two components and attempt to create tension and fear within the viewer. 
    <br><br>Specific visual components I took from Virtual Reality - Computer Chronicles (1992) included clips that showed people using the technology and the virtual worlds that they were exploring. the clip in which the presenter was typing words on the computer screen recurred throughout my video, as I wanted to remove this context from the video and manipulate it to appear as if the computer was typing this itself. I avoided using sections that focused solely on the presenters as this would not add to my narrative around technology being something to fear. The power that sound has to manipulate the tone of a scene was an effective tool I used throughout the video. With a combination of the narration from ‘The Medium is the Message’, sound effects and music, I attempted to create an ominous feel. 
    <br><br>Throughout the video, there were three key chapters I attempted to create. The first chapter was intended to be slower than the later two, introducing the technological interference and the ominous feel around VR technology. The next chapter sees the music start to pick up, and the technological interference becomes more frequent. The final chapter is where the pace reaches its peak, with the interference becoming erratic and the music reaching its crescendo. The edits throughout become faster, ending with a final cut to black and music winding down to slow the pace and leave the audience considering the ending of the video.  
    <br><br>The primary aesthetic choices I made to express my theme of horror and fear were the use of technology visuals juxtaposed with the people using them. These visuals in combination with music and audio that contributed to an ominous feel made the aesthetics of the video feel almost unhinged and erratic, intentional for the theme I was aiming for. </p>

  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
  <p>This webpage was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, featuring a series of 9 icons created with Illustrator features 9 different impacts of climate change. These icons were created with flat design techniques in order to depict these impacts in a cohesive way that builds unity between the icons. The icons were first created using sketching techniques and then transferred into illustrator. The final interactions of these icons were then added to an HTML file, with the use of CSS and JavaScript to create a simple webpage. This webpage was then put onto GitHub. </p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The idea behind my suite of icons was to display in a simple visual format the impacts of climate change. I chose this theme due to my interest in environmental issues, as well as the opportunity to create icons with human and environmental visuals to link to these issues. To make a set of concrete visual designs, I first narrowed the prompt down to an idea with clear visual counterparts. By focusing on the impacts of climate change, I gave more clear ideas to the prompt of ‘climate’. This also made other aspects of the design process easier, as for impacts such as ‘flooding’, there are already clear icons used globally on objects such as road signs to indicate this, giving me visual inspiration to work from to create my own version of these icons. 
    <br><br>The first stage of the process to create the icons involved rough sketches of each icon idea. To translate these sketches into Illustrator, I took pictures of my sketches, importing these images into Illustrator onto a background layer. I then locked this layer, and using the shape tool made the key shapes within the icons. From here, I used the pen tool to map out more complex shapes. Next, I merged the shapes together to make the icon's core shapes into one object and made the corners of the shapes rounded. I then changed colours and experimented with different combinations. 
    <br><br>The use of colour in my icons was considered in order to create a sense of unity within my designs. The use of monochromatic colours in the blue field I found to be most appropriate for this project as the colour blue is often associated with natural elements such as water. I also used blue as the emotions behind blue as associated with sadness or thoughtfulness, appropriate for the tone of the icons. To create some visual interest I used red and orange tones in some icons to create variety, however, I only put these colours in a pattern to continue the sense of unity. 
    <br><br>The elements and principles of sound corresponded to the design used in the icons as I made a conscious effort to create unity between the sounds. I tried to avoid making any sounds greatly stand out through balancing audio levels and also tried to make the sounds logical to the visual shapes in the icons, without contrasting too much with the other sound effects. 
    <br><br>In finalising my solutions, I went through a number of iterations before deciding on a final solution for each of my nine icons. In developing my icons, my core focuses were on ensuring there was a sense of unity between the icons, both with the colours and shapes used, as well as the scale of the icons within their shape containers. Another of my focuses was on the simplicity of the icons. I wanted to ensure I stayed within the brief of flat design and wanted to keep the aesthetic quality of the icons minimalistic. These were the considerations I made when deciding upon my final solutions for the icons.

<h2>Final Video</h2>

<p>The theme within this virtual environment was around the change of growing up. To unify elements of my virtual environment under this theme, with an emphasis on fantasy, I attempted to use models that looked consistent throughout the environment. However, as a key aspect of the design was the change occurring throughout, I used more colourful pinks and purples in the ‘fantasy’ area, with more realistic colours appearing throughout the environment. 
<br><br>
    Sound was used in a variety of ways within this project. First, a  wind/natural environment sound was added to the player, so that the environment would not feel empty wherever the player was located, and to create a sense of immersion. Additionally, sound effects were attached to the fairies that the player would only hear within a certain radius, to add to the fantasy element of the environment. In each area, I also added different music, with the first area having a piano track that was fantastical while also being childish and fun. The next area's music develops into a slightly more mature track, while still having lighthearted energy. The final environment has a piano track that I found to be more melancholy, but still beautiful and peaceful. I used this music to create a journey for the player, creating a different feeling in each environment.

    In designing a three-dimensional environment as opposed to a 2D environment I found a difference in the need to consistently change the angle you are looking at your design to ensure that objects are being placed where intended. I also found that I had more freedom, however with this freedom came more things to consider to make my design solution fit the brief as well as I could. The role of the virtual camera also differed in this assignment compared to the first assignment, as the camera was attached to the player as a first person, with the viewer able to control the scene they saw. This makes the camera a far more immersive tool for the viewer, however also meant that it was in my control to make the environment as interesting as possible, from many different angles. 
    <br><br>
 
    A working prototype was very important to my design process as it created a clear visualisation of the environment, highlighting any flaws with the overall layout. It also allowed me to hear any issues with audio, and see any problems with 3D models or the physics of the environment. From here I was able to fix some issues, improving the overall design of my 3D environment. Through playtesting I discovered that my water was not functioning properly due to a mesh collider. I also found that the bridges sometimes got the player stuck in one location. The audio in the playtest also found some issues with volume and the distance the player could hear the audio. These are issues that I would have been unable to identify without having a player physically explore the environment I had created.
